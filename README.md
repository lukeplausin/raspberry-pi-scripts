# raspberry-pi-scripts
A collection of code to use with my Raspberry Pi

# What does it do?

- Use DuckDNS for dynamic DNS so that you can access your raspberry pi from anywhere (you need to set up port forwarding on your router and create a duckdns account for this to work).
- Set up SSHD so that you can login to bash over the network.
- Sets up PEM keys.
- Install wordpress server.
